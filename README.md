Again a small project built on freeCodeCamp, this time introducing some accessibility tools. Learning to build applications which can be used by everybody seems to be mandatory nowadays, a fact i'm really fond of. Learning to use semantic tags properly seems to be pretty complicated because a lot of this elements are situationnals and the rules dictating their use sometimes lacks clarity in my opinion. The better option for now is probably for me to set my own standard and apply it on each and every project.
As for the features i discovered on this project, there's two which really sticked:
_ the *accesskey* attribute because i love shortcuts!
_ the css property _scroll-behavior_ (and the _smooth_ value) because i noticed a lot of website using it but never really researched who the culprit was...
